# My Notes for [Theoretical Minimum Courses](http://theoreticalminimum.com/)

## Lecture Notes based on Leonard Susskind's [Theoretical Minimum](http://theoreticalminimum.com/home)

**Disclaimer** I have created these notes as an aide-m√©moire for my own use; if you find them useful, you are welcome, but I'd appreciate it if you'd let me know if you are using them. They are _not_ intended 
as a substitute for listening to the lectures. The intellectual property for all material derived from the lectures belongs, of course, to Professor Susskind; any mistakes, however, are my own.

The notes were created using [TexStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/), which I recommend for compiling them to a PDF, and the bibliography was created using [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/).
