\section{The expanding (Newtonian) universe}\label{sec:expanding:newton}

\begin{quotation}
	This lecture focuses on the classical or Newtonian view of the universe.  Beginning with the assumption of an isotropic universe with gravity as the only significant cosmic-scale force, Professor Susskind derives the equation for the Hubble constant, and demonstrates that the universe cannot be static -- that it must be expanding or contracting.
\end{quotation}

Cosmology as a science dates back to the discovery of the microwave radiation from the Big Bang in the 1960s. Before that Cosmology was more like natural science--classifying oddities. Thinking of the universe as a physical system, as a system to study mathematically, with a set of physical principles and a set of equations is relatively new.

We will study the universe as a physical system, i.e. something we can study with equations.

\begin{itemize}
	\item First observation: the universe is \gls{gls:isotropic}, averaging over patches of the sky, so it should be \gls{gls:homogenous}. If not we'd have shells centered on Earth!

	\item There are around $10^{11}$ galaxies within view of Earth, which we can treat as particles. Each galaxy has roughly $10^{11}$ stars.
	
	\item Gravity is only force that matters at cosmological scales: it pulls stuff together. Should stuff remain static?
\end{itemize}

Could Newton have figured out expanding universe given observations?

\subsection{How would Newton have handled expanding universe?}

 We postulate a more general formula for distance between two galaxies $a$ and $b$:
 
 \begin{align*}            
 	D_{ab}=&a(t) \sqrt{\Delta_{ab} x^2 + \Delta_{ab} y^2 + \Delta_{ab} z^2}  \text{, where $a(t)$ is called the ''scale factor''}
\end{align*}
 Now calculate velocity           
 \begin{align*}	
 	V_{ab}=&\dot{a} \Delta X_{ab} \text{, neglecting $y$ and $z$}\\
 	\frac{V_{ab}}{D_{ab}} =& \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \text{, independent of choice of galaxies!}\\
 	=& H \text{, Hubble constant at a given time.}\\
 	V =& H D \text{, Hubble's Law.}
\end{align*}
 
\subsection{How much mass is in $\Delta x \Delta y \Delta z$?}

Assume  $\Delta x \Delta y \Delta z$ big enough that we can average over the small scale structure. How much mass is in there? Let $M$ denote the mass within $\Delta x \Delta y \Delta z$, and $M = \nu \Delta x \Delta y \Delta z$ Let $V$ denote the volume.

\begin{align*}
	V =& a^3 \Delta x \Delta y \Delta z\\
	M =& \nu \Delta x \Delta y \Delta z \text{, constant}\\
	\rho(t) =& \frac{\nu}{a(t)^3} \numberthis \label{eq:rho}
\end{align*}

Amount of mass in a given region of Figure \ref{fig:cosmo-1-grid} remains the same, as galaxies move with grid.

Choose grid to Newton at rest at centre of universe. He looks out at distant galaxy, which move in accordance with Newton's laws. He would use Newton's Theorem--Figure \ref{fig:newtons:thm}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption[Newton's Theorem]{Newton's Theorem: to determine gravitational force on red body, assuming isotropy, draw sphere and calculate force if mass inside concentrated sphere in centre, and ignore mass outside.}\label{fig:newtons:thm}

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{align*}
	D =& a(t) \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}\\
	=&a(t) R \text{, say} \numberthis \label{eq:D}
\end{align*}
R is constant, since galaxy at fixed point in lattice. We want acceleration so we can use Newton's laws.
\begin{align*}
	V =& \dot{a(t)} R\\
	A =& \ddot{a(t)}R
\end{align*}
From Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
\begin{align*}
	F =& - \frac{mMG}{D^2}\\
	A =& - \frac{MG}{D^2} \text{, which should become}\\
	=& \ddot{a(t)}R
\end{align*}
So we want
\begin{align*}
	\ddot{a(t)}R =& - \frac{MG}{D^2}\\
	=& - \frac{MG}{a^2 R^2} \text{, from \eqref{eq:D}}\\
	\frac{\ddot{a(t)}}{a} =& - \frac{MG}{a^3 R^3}\text{, now volume is}\\
	V =& \frac{4 \pi}{3}  a^3 R^3\\
	\frac{\ddot{a(t)}}{a}=& -\frac{4 \pi}{3} G \rho \text{, from definition of $\rho$} \numberthis \label{eq:a}
\end{align*}

Now $\rho$ does not depend in $R$, so \eqref{eq:a} applies for every galaxy. This is true for any origin, as long as we do the transformation carefully. Everything hinges on the assumption that the universe is homogeneous.

We can see from \eqref{eq:a} that the universe is not static unless $\rho=0$. Let us substitute \eqref{eq:rho} in \eqref{eq:a}.

\begin{align*}
	\frac{\ddot{a(t)}}{a} =& \frac{4 \pi}{3} \frac{G \nu}{a^3}  \numberthis \label{eq:friedmann}
\end{align*}

This was discovered by Friedmann, in the context of General Relativity. It doesn't tell us whether universe is expanding or creating, but tells us that acceleration is negative. But observation says that it isn't! This would have been the standard model before we found that expansion is accelerating.

\end{figure}

We will write down the energy equation: total energy is $\frac{1}{2}m v^2 -\frac{m M G}{x}$. What is escape velocity if total energy is zero?
\begin{align*}
	\frac{1}{2}\cancel{m} V^2 -\frac{\cancel{m} M G}{X} =& 0\\
	V^2 =& \frac{2 M G}{X}
\end{align*}
Similarly in \eqref{eq:friedmann}, total energy can by positive, negative or zero.
\begin{itemize}
	\item If energy great enough, universe does not turn around: it expands forever.
	\item If energy smaller, universe eventually contracts.
	\item Escape velocity is edge.
\end{itemize}

In Figure \ref{fig:newtons:thm}, all the particle knows is that it is moving under influence of mass concentrated at origin, so we can treat as Figure \ref{fig:cosmo:throw:rock}.

The Total Energy is given by $\frac{1}{2} m \dot{a}^2 R^2 -\frac{m M G}{a R}$. In the edge case where energy is zero
\begin{align*}
	 \dot{a}^2 R^2 -\frac{2 M G}{a R} =& 0 \\
	 \frac{\dot{a}^2 }{a^2} -\frac{2 M G \frac{4}{3} \pi}{\frac{4}{3} \pi a^3 R^3} =& 0 \\
	 {\underbrace{\big(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\big)}_\text{Hubble}}^2 =& \frac{4 \pi}{3} G \rho \numberthis \label{eq:friedmann:eq}
\end{align*}
Equation \eqref{eq:friedmann:eq} is known as the Friedmann equation. This universe will get slower and slower, but never collapse.

Using \eqref{eq:rho}, \eqref{eq:friedmann:eq} becomes:
\begin{align*}
	\big(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\big)^2 =& \frac{8 \pi \nu}{3}\frac{G}{a^3} \numberthis \label{eq:friedmann:8}\\
	\big(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\big)^2 =& \frac{1}{a^3} \text{, using suitable units}
\end{align*}
RHS is always positive, and decreases as $a$ increases, but slows.
Try $a=ct^P$
\begin{align*}
	a=&ct^P\\
	\dot{a}=&^c P t^{P-1}\\
	\frac{\dot{a}}{a}=& \frac{P}{t}\\
	\frac{P^2}{t^2} =& \frac{1}{c^3 t^{3P}} \text{, whence}\\
	3P =& 2\\
	P =& \frac{2}{3}\\
	P^2 =& \frac{1}{C^3}
\end{align*}

Newton speculated about a homogeneous universe, but didn't carry out the calculation.

\section{Matter and radiation dominated universes}

\begin{quotation}
	After reviewing the basic equation for an expanding universe, Professor Susskind solves the equation explicitly for a zero energy universe, and then extends the derivation to universes with non-zero energy.  These universes can take two forms: matter-dominated universes, and radiation-dominated universes.  The radiation-dominated form characterizes our early universe, and the matter-dominated form characterizes our universe today -- or so cosmologists believed until observations led to theories of dark energy in the 1990s.
\end{quotation}

Did Newton get it right? Yes, mostly. Einstein's equations deal with curved space-time, and some of the universes we will study have curved 3-space--maybe a 3-sphere. Suppose we just look at very neighbouring galaxies, where it will look flat. Then in a small region we can use Newton;s equations. So what we did in Section \ref{sec:expanding:newton} should be OK, as long as we don't have two galaxies moving past each other at a speed comparable to that of light (OK for galaxies that are a long way away).

Now photons and neutrinos are moving very fast, so  we have to modifiy our equations to deal with this.

Treat matter in galaxies as uniform density $\rho$. Lay down grid as in Figure \ref{fig:cosmo-1-grid}. How big is spacing? Equations should not depend on spacing, but maybe the ratios matter. If a doubles, we have expansion.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{Equations should not depend on spacing.}
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{cosmo-2-grid}
\end{figure}

We could measure expansion by $\frac{\dot{a}}{a}$.

Another ambiguity is $\nu$, which depends on $a$.

In Section \ref{sec:expanding:newton} we derived \eqref{eq:friedmann:8}, which reduces to:
\begin{align*}
	\big(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\big)^2 =& \frac{8 \pi G \rho}{3}
\end{align*}

$\frac{8 \pi}{3}$ is related to the volume of a sphere. The equation assumes zero energy, or, equivalently, galaxies moving at escape velocity.

Is $\nu$ constant? If we assume, for the moment, that protons and galaxies are forever, then yes, $\nu$ is constant. Box grows, but number of particles in box remains constant. Recall \eqref{eq:friedmann:8}:
\begin{align*}
	\big(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\big)^2 =& \frac{8 \pi \nu}{3}\frac{G}{a^3} \\
	\big(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\big)^2 =& \frac{1}{a^3} \text{, using suitable units} \numberthis \label{eq:friedmann:normalized}
\end{align*}

We can solve \eqref{eq:friedmann:normalized}.

\begin{align*}
	\dot{a} =& \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}\\
	\frac{dt}{da} =& \sqrt{a}\\
	t = \frac{2}{3}a^{\frac{3}{2}}\\
	a = t^\frac{2}{3} \text{, ignoring some constant}
\end{align*}

\begin{figure}
	\caption{$a = t^\frac{2}{3}$}
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figs/cosmo-2-a-t}
\end{figure}
\section{Geometries of space: flat, spherical, hyperbolic}

\begin{quotation}
	Professor Susskind presents three possible geometries of homogeneous space: flat (infinite), spherical (positively curved and finite), hyperbolic (negatively curved and infinite). He develops the metric for these three spatial geometries in spherical coordinates, and describes methodologies for determining which geometry represents our universe. To date, we have not been able to detect curvature in our universe. Professor Susskind concludes the lecture by introducing a time-dependent scale factor into the metric for each of these geometries.
\end{quotation}

\section{Cosmological Thermodynamics}

\begin{quotation}
	The time-time component of Einstein's field equations for general relativity relate energy density to the geometry of space.  Using this energy density, Professor Susskind presents the thermodynamic equation of state which relates the energy density to pressure.  He uses this equation to derive how the density of the universe relates to the scale factor for matter- and radiation-dominated universes, and gives a brief preview of how dark energy affects this analysis.
\end{quotation}

\section{Vacuum energy}

\begin{quotation}
	After a review of the equations of state presented in the last lecture, Professor Susskind derives the density parameter for an energy dominated universe.  He then introduces the concept of vacuum energy, which is represented by the cosmological constant, and is one possible form of dark energy, and describes the characteristics of the universe under various values of the cosmological constant and curvature.
\end{quotation}

\section{Dark matter and allocation of energy density}

\begin{quotation}
	Professor Susskind develops the energy density allocation equation, and describes the historical progress of the effort to find the correct values for the terms in this equation.  This analysis combined with observations of the motion of stars and galaxies led cosmologists to postulate the existence of dark matter.  Observations of luminosity and red-shift have led to the correct solution for today's universe - which is dominated by dark energy.
\end{quotation}

\section{Temperature History of the Universe}

\begin{quotation}
	Professor Susskind examines the temperature history of our universe.  The universe switched from radiation-dominated to matter-dominated when it was about one million times hotter than it is today.  At that time, matter and energy decoupled from each other and the universe became transparent to radiation when it was about one thousand times hotter that it is today.
\end{quotation}

\section{Baryogenesis}

\begin{quotation}
	Professor Susskind opens the lecture with one of the fundamental questions in cosmology: why are there more protons than anti-protons in the universe today? The answer lies in theory of baryogenesis in the very early universe.  This theory leads to the Sakharov conditions, and the fact that the only general symmetry requirement under all conditions is complete charge-parity-time (CPT) symmetry.
	
	Professor Susskind then introduces the concept of inflation in the early universe.  He derives the basic equations of motion for inflation by starting with the equations for a falling particle in a gravitational field and a viscous fluid
\end{quotation}

\section{Inflation}

\begin{quotation}
	
	
	Professor Susskind introduces the theory of cosmological inflation under which the early universe underwent an exponential expansion during which it doubled in size every 10-32 seconds and expanded by at least a factor of e90.  This all occurred prior to the Big Bang and during this period the universe cooled very rapidly and was essentially empty.  In the early phase of this rapid expansion, the universe was hot enough that magnetic monopoles were formed.  However these were the only particles formed.  The rest of the energy of the universe was contained in the potential energy of the inflaton field, and it wasn't until the Big Bang that this potential energy was converted into the particles that form the matter that makes up the galaxies in the universe today.
	
	This theory of rapid explnsion explains the lack of observed magnetic monopoles and the uniformity of the cosmic microwave background radiation.  The rapid expansion dispersed the monopoles, smoothed out the distribution of photons, and also flattened space itself.
	
\end{quotation}

\section{Inhomogeneities and quantum fluctuations}

\begin{quotation}
Professor Susskind describes the theory whereby inhomogeneities in the universe were caused by quantum fluctuations in the early universe.  He begins with the mathematical equations of a damped harmonic oscillator, and relates that simple system to a dissipative inflaton field with spatial dependencies.  The quantum fluctuations in the zero point energy states of this field lead to inhomogeneities in the universe.  These inhomogeneities explain both the small variations in the cosmic microwave background, as well as the formation of galaxies from regions of high energy density.
